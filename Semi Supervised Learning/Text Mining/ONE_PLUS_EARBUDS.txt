"first of all with mi 18 watt charger,it got full charged in 20mins.that was amazing and 16-18hrs playtime is best at this price range.I searched for a wireless earphone and bought many but finally settled with this.sound quality is good but build quality is premium.overall i would say it is the best earphone to go with and I guarantee you will not regret.drop like if you find it useful.

"LONG BUT WORTH READING.Honest review after one week. Just go for it. Dont get affected by negative reviews. Totally worth every penny and far ahead of its competition. The battery backup is splendid. Sound quality is very good nothing to complain here. Comfortable in the ears. Connectivity perfect. I haven't experienced any lag with normal media usage. I am a student and watch video lectures at sometimes 2x speed and never once I faced voice lag while changing video speed. Just go for it. Ju...

"Awesome battery backup for 15 hour continuouslyBuild quality is greatAnd call quality is superIn can be used continuously for whole dayAnd sound quality is better then other competitors in market.Worth to spend a little more money on this then Realme and Xiaomi.And the best bart is i mainly use it for PUBG.But i have Oneplus 7 Pro so that could be the reason also, that i didn't face any sound delay.If you don't have Oneplus device you could face sound delay in gaming.GO FOR IT......!

"Amazing headset at such an awesome price. Internationally its priced $49 dollars which converts to Rs 3,689/- approximately according to the currency exchange rates today. Sound Quality is Awesome.Bass is a bit lacking.Battery Backup is awesome. (Also it charges completely within 1 hour with a 5W charger!)Features are top notch.

"The earphone ticks all the boxes. But what really sets it apart is its surprisingly clear clarity specially the vocals which are top notch. All the sounds are very discernible which makes it all the more pleasant.

"Ultimate beast in this range. The battery back up is killer in all classes. Easily runs more than 15 hours in a full charge. Speed charging takes only about 25 minutes from 0% to 100%. Sound quality is smooth, soft and clear. Bass is a bit low but using the correct ear bud can partially offset the  problem.  Connection quality is good. Connects fast (3 secs with Redmi note 7 pro. Switching between devices takes no more than 8 secs. Build quality is elegant and feels veery expensive.
