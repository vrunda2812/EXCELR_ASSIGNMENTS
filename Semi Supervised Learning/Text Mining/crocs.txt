"My old crocs were worn and didn't have any tread on the bottom anymore, decided to buy a new pair and I am glad I did. I forgot how much grip a new pair of crocs has, if you intend to use crocs for boating of any kind, new tread makes a world of difference. This pair of crocs is nearly identical to crocs Ive owned in the past, if it isn't broken don't fix it right? If you are looking for a comfortable shoe that can be easily slipped on look no further than the classic crocs.
                                  "

"I always put a hold on purchasing these because I never liked the way they looked and the price was just too expensive for me. This time around it was different, I did not care about how ugly or funny they looked or how much they cost, but I just wanted some shoes to give me support, make my feet feel less pain and discomfort for standing and for walking. I will share with you my experience with my first and last pair of crocs.
                                  "

"I have had about 6-7 different pairs of these throughout the years in multiple different colors. They are perfect for a variety of situations. They can be used as shower shoes, beach/pool shoes, house shoes, yard shoes, and more. The only problem with these is the grip on the bottom. You would think that since they are rubber they have great grip, but this is not the case. The grip is average when they are brand new, but quickly gets worse and worse due to the soft rubber of the sole. This is not a huge deal for me as I don't wear these shoes for anything too intense, but something to note. I would still recommend these to anybody looking for an extra pair of shoes to throw on at any moment.

"Not sure if it’s only in Hawaii, but this younger generation has a weird fondness for crocs (which went out in the 80’s) and it’s only the white ones. My son really likes them, and says he can walk all day without his feet hurting. I like the fact that it has holes all over so he doesn’t get stinky teenage boy feet. Now are the wet months here and the shoes can be hosed down when mud and grass sticks to them. It’s a super great price so I would definitely buy them again if they ever wear out which seems next to impossible for these things.
                                 " 

"Look no further! I'm just back here reminiscing...because I bought the Crocband Clog and they are sooo uncomfortable! I'm so sad that I tried to get clever and get something cuter with a sporty little band of color around the sole...and my toes are slamming into the ends and rubbing raw. BUMMER. Buy these. Don't make the mistake I did. Remind yourself what I forgot: We wear Crocs because they are comfortable not because they are beautiful. Take it. Take the comfort. Buy other shoes for when it's time to look cute. Here's me hobbling around the house miserable looking SOOO cute. UGH!

"I’ve got vinyl flooring laid on concrete. Sure, Crocs are like the girl you may have never asked to the prom- but then you got to know her and you realize you have more in common that you would have ever thought. She too likes the comforting sounds of Stix and Ambrosia. Next thing ya know you’re pinning on a corsage and arm and arm you March through the doors of the prom. Why you ask? Because COMFORT. Looks aren’t everything. Personality goes a long way. Do Crocs/can Crocs have personality? I would argue yes because it the way they make your feet feel. Less pained, less strained and they give you a bounce to your step which makes walking on hard floors painless. So Crocs- will you go to prom with me?

"I bought these to wear on a vacation to Cabo. I had brought other sandal’s, but wore these 90% of the time. I wore them to the pool, walking long distances, and as slippers. They are super comfortable and for me, that is a major plus since I have had a few surgeries on my feet over the years. I bought white, and they show very little dirt. I only had a couple of smudges on them after walking all over the place with them. A Mr. clean pad makes them look brand new with no effort. I would buy these again!
                             "

"hey look embarrassing to wear for me, but my last pair lasted 7 years while I wore out 14 pairs of sneakers, two pairs of dress shoes and two pairs of military boots during the same period. If the end of the world was going to happen, bringing along a pair of these. The strap may break, but the shoes will outlast everything else you use daily. You may not have socks or clothes but you will still have your Crocks. Provided they are not stolen and you don't loose them like I lost my last set on vacation.
If I hadn't lost them I would still be wearing my 7 year old Crocks.
                            "

"My son and I went to the Crocs store and they didn't have the size in the color he wanted. Almost an hour trip..blegh.
We didn't go online for the shopping and food experience.. you know.. an outing together.
We came back home and went online immediately and found exactly what he wanted and the size and on sale for nearly HALF the cost!!! Score! I love croc shoes for their durability. I don't like them for water because they slip on wet surfaces. In my experience. I bought my husband a pair of Crocs slippers over twelve years ago and he still wears them every night.
I had a pair of Crocs my young son outgrew for the longest time. I finally ditched them about eight years later only because I got another pair that actually fit me. They were used in horse stalls and gardens and were still in great condition even though they were very dirty..when I threw them out. Not the nicest looking shoe, but comfortable. They form to your walk. After the heat and wear.. they start slightly giving in and becoming super comfortable.

"This review is long overdue but better late than never! I bought these as a surprise gift despite my hubs saying he had purposefully resisted the Croc craze for no good reason. Anyway, I was tired of seeing him walking around his work shed and garage barefoot and messing up his feet. He's a tall guy with large, wide hobbit feet so I was worried about the width but needn't have been. He put them on and the rest is history. He bought Crocs for everyone in his family that Christmas and is on his third pair he's worn them out so much. Says it all. 5 stars!

"hey are so cute I am a croc lover that was my fourth pair ! As a person with wider feet I would recommend to size up . I wear a 7 but I got a 8 👍 . But it also depends on how you would like them to fit ! Other that that get them they come in clutch !,
                             "

"I have this pair about a month, when I was told I had to wear something to support my feet around the house, that would not cause slipping incidents. After several attempts to get slippers to stay on my feet, I got these. I was surprised DHL actually shipped them successfully from Spain, it appears. I was pleased to get them in one of my favorite colors. They are very comfortable, and take a lot of the stress off my feet. But most importantly, the strap ensures the Crocs don't slip off my feet going up and down stairs, so I am not changing shoes.
                             "

"I have been wearing Crocs for years. Time for two new pairs, bought the slate gray a few weeks ago and the black last week. My old ones are the Freesail style and are a bit narrow, these are much more comfortable. Plan to wear them with socks until the weather gets warm. Great prices on Amazon too. I did notice when clicking on the different colors that depending on the color they are made of different materials.
                             "

"I always said I would never purchase Crocs because they are hideous. Now I’m writing this review in my first pair that I’ve been wearing everyday for 3 weeks. Never say never. The first day I wasn’t impressed. I swear they molded to my foot though. I work in a fast paced job and I’m on my feet the whole time. These have replaced my Brooks Ghost 14. They are light, feet my foot great, and have good grip. My feet don’t hurt as bad after work. I still find them hideous but I’m still going to wear them.

"I have been wanting these crocs for months, but this color was sold out in my size. When I saw they came back in stock I had to get them! These crocs are so cute and they’re the perfect shade of pink, im so excited to accessorize then with jibbitz. I would recommend sizing down as crocs do tend to run a size larger, im usually a size 8 women's and I ordered these in a size 7 women’s and they fit perfectly!
                            "

" bought a pair for myself & a pair for my baby’s father & they both fit, the photos are just of mine tho, i didn’t get any pics of his feet in his lol…. We both wear the same size & we both agree that we could’ve gone up a half a size/a full size, but they still do fit, as you can see in the photos…. I finally got me a pair of crocs !! 😂😂😂😩😩 I’m probably the last person in the United States to get me a pair 😂 but my daughter has had a pair since summer 2021 tho. That’s one thing about it, is we keep our daughter fly before we get ourselves fly 🤣 iykyk 💪🏽💪🏽❤️🤞🏽 (the little butterfly jibbit came separately…. Yk i gotta say that for the slow people in the back lol 😝)
                              "

"I was absolutely AMAZED at how fast these shoes shipped! I needed to replace the ones I’ve been wearing for years and was so happy to find these at such a reasonable price. They were exactly as listed: brand new, correct size & nice, clean white. This seller was PROMPT, which is what Im looking for when buying a product online. Was looking at their other products & Will buy from this seller again! (Jibbitz in photo not included)
                             "

"Purchased as a requested back-to-school gift for my 14-year-old grand-son, and he seemed satisfied with it. Because there were no half-sizes to match his preferred current size, the next higher size was ordered. He said it was a bit big but, being 14, his feet may still grow some more. Unless I hear back something to the contrary, I'll call it, Mission accomplished!
                             "

"i didn't like crocs at first, but once i saw potential with the cute charms, i just knew i like it! made a diy beaded as well, it fits pretty good and comfortable, although it is a little small for me (my fault because I decide to chose size 4 in women's, (i'm usually a 5-5.5), but they were out of stock. it still fits though, as long i have the croc handle on my heel to keep it secure! TYYY TO MY BF WHO BOUGHT THIS FOR MEE + charms <3
                            "

"I wear these all the time now. I have a lot of problems with my feet after numerous surgeries, but these shoes are so surprisingly comfortable. I can wear them all day and my feet do not hurt at all. When I’m wearing other shoes with my orthotics, by the end of the day my feet are sore and tired, but mot with these. I’m so happy to have been turned into these by my sister. I’m now collecting different colors so I can wear them with just about everything! You will not be disappointed. I normally wear a size 8 so my orthotics will fit in the shoe. I ordered an 8 in these and they are the perfect size.
                            "

"I bought these for my roommate for general running around shoes, they are not attractive but I observed that in doctors offices and hospitals they all wear them and I asked once and a nurse told me they were thee most comfortable shoes out there. My roommate agrees, I am glad I was able to buy a pair for him.
                            "

"I  bought this for my daughter to wear at school. She loves it so much that she’s asking for more colors. It’s comfortable, lightweight and durable. Also, it’s very easy to clean! Just use water and dish soap. She has wide feet and they were just perfect and provides good arch support since she wears them for long hours without complaining.
                           "

"I love crocs they are great for many occasions and are as expected I got the black ones in size 7 for women. Normally I wear a 7.5 but these fit great. Plenty of toe space, but I do kind of have to have the back strap on when walking around or I feel like I’ve got too much movement, but any smaller or bigger in size just wouldn’t do. 
                           "

"These are my first pair of Crocs. I have small, narrow feet with a high arch. Every time I've tried on Crocs, I felt like my feet were lost in them. With the strap on the heel I can actually keep them on my feet! They are great for what I purchased them for, which is to wear to do yard work. They are loose enough to get air flow, they rinse off when dirty, and they provide some protection for my feet.
